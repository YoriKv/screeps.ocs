I proudly announce our first outline of constitution. 
Please everybody read through it and give some feedback. 
Everybody who would like to take one of those roles should also please notify me. 

As of thursday, the 10.11.2016 (dd.mm.yyyy) I will try to call for elections. 

Elections will follow this schedule.

2. Election (tool tbd) (duration at least 28 hours or until 100% turnout)
3. Announcement of results and employment
