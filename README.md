### 2. Ingame behaviour

1. Aggressive acts against players of the group (OCS) or any other alliance, as listed on the LOAN map (http://www.leagueofautomatednations.com/map), require consensus of the group. 
2. Smaller players without membership in an alliance can be harmed or eliminated by individual decision. These are only those players with owned rooms < 4 and GCL < 5.
3. Players without membership in an alliance which don't fall into the definition of ยง2 may not get harmed, but should get an official invitation for the group at first.  
  1. The invited player has a time limit of 5 days to react.
  2. The invited player may be target of aggressive actions if he/she does not react within the time limit.
  3. If the invited player reacts on the invitation (before or after the time limit) and is not joining the alliance he may be harmed/eliminated, unless there are reasons and a consensus of the group not to do so.
